# Intuition

The problem requires merging two strings alternately, character by character. We need to take characters from both strings in alternating fashion until one or both strings are exhausted.

## Approach

1. Split both input strings into character arrays
2. Use a while loop to iterate while either array has characters remaining
3. In each iteration, add one character from each string (if available) to the result array
4. Join the result array into a single string

## Complexity

- Time complexity: $$O(m + n)$$ where m and n are the lengths of word1 and word2 respectively
- Space complexity: $$O(m + n)$$ for storing the character arrays and result array

## Edge Cases

- **One string empty**: If `word1` is empty, the result should be `word2`, and vice versa.
- **Different lengths**: When one string is longer than the other, the extra characters from the longer string should simply be appended at the end.
- **Single-character strings**: Inputs like `word1 = "a"`, `word2 = "b"` test the minimal non-empty case.
- **All same characters**: Cases like `word1 = "aaa"`, `word2 = "bbb"` help verify the strict alternation pattern (`"ababab"`).
- **Very long strings**: Large inputs check that the loop correctly terminates when both arrays are exhausted and there are no off-by-one errors.

## Code

```typescript
function mergeAlternately(word1: string, word2: string): string {
  const word1Split = word1.split("");
  const word2Split = word2.split("");
  const merged: string[] = [];
  while (word1Split.length > 0 || word2Split.length > 0) {
    if (word1Split.length > 0) {
      merged.push(word1Split.shift());
    }
    if (word2Split.length > 0) {
      merged.push(word2Split.shift());
    }
  }
  return merged.join("");
}
```
