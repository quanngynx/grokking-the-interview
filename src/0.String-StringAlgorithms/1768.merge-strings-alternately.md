# Intuition

The problem requires merging two strings alternately, character by character. We need to take characters from both strings in alternating fashion until one or both strings are exhausted.

# Approach

1. Split both input strings into character arrays
2. Use a while loop to iterate while either array has characters remaining
3. In each iteration, add one character from each string (if available) to the result array
4. Join the result array into a single string

# Complexity

- Time complexity: $$O(m + n)$$ where m and n are the lengths of word1 and word2 respectively
- Space complexity: $$O(m + n)$$ for storing the character arrays and result array

# Code

```typescript []
function mergeAlternately(word1: string, word2: string): string {
  const word1Split = word1.split("");
  const word2Split = word2.split("");
  const merged: string[] = [];
  while (word1Split.length > 0 || word2Split.length > 0) {
    if (word1Split.length > 0) {
      merged.push(word1Split.shift());
    }
    if (word2Split.length > 0) {
      merged.push(word2Split.shift());
    }
  }
  return merged.join("");
}
```
